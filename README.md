# Hexapawn-AI

A while ago, I started working on a 5x5 Hexapawn AI, and just recently returned to improve it. I am continuously working on updating it, but here is the newest version of the code. While the visual interface looks nice, the AI takes a few seconds to solve for difficult positions. Here are some coming improvements:

- Represent Game States in Binary (Bitboard)
- Improve the beginning move dictionary

Run the Hexapawn.py file to play the game. Note: This code requires the pygame library.
