# Hexapawn-AI

A while ago, I started working on a 5x5 Hexapawn AI, and just recently returned to improve it. I am continuously working on updating it, but here is the newest version of the code. You play as red (player 2) and the AI plays as blue (player 1). While the visual interface looks nice, the AI takes a few seconds to generate the first move. Here are some coming improvements:

- Represent Game States in Binary (Bitboard)
- Make a home screen where the play can select whether to play as red or blue (player 1 or 2)
- Precompute a beginning move dictionary because my attention span can't handle waiting 8s for it to calculate the first move

Run the Hexapawn.py file to play the game. Note: This code requires the pygame library.
