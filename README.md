# Hexapawn-AI

A while ago, I started working on a 5x5 Hexapawn AI, and just recently returned to improve it. Although I am continuously working on improving the code, I would like to share with you the latest version. In this game, you will play as red, and the AI will play as blue. The AI is programmed to win every game, but it may take a few seconds to calculate the best move on the first turn. Here are some of the upcoming improvements that I have planned:

- Represent Game States in Binary (Bitboard)
- Make a home screen where the play can select whether to play as red or blue (player 1 or 2)
- Precompute a beginning move dictionary because my attention span can't handle waiting 8s for it to calculate the first move

Run the Hexapawn.py file to play the game. Note: This code requires the pygame library.
