# Hexapawn-AI

This is a 5x5 hexapawn AI that I started working on a while ago, and just came back to try to improve it. There are many things that I am working on to improve the code, but here is the most recent version of it. You play as red and the ai plays as blue. The AI should win every time, but it does take a few seconds to calculate the best move on the first turn. Here are some of the coming improvements:

- Represent Game States in Binary (Bitboard)
- Make a home screen where the play can select whether to play as red or blue (player 1 or 2)
- Precompute a beginning move dictionary because my attention span can't handle waiting 8s for it to calculate the first move

Run the Hexapawn.py file to play the game. Note: This code requires the pygame library.
